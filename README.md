## Introduction

The program evaluates and tests some algorithms and finds the best evaluation measure for it with different photos.

## The Results of the 2D Evaluation

![2D Evaluation for Image 1](./Docs/src/rdb005ll%20table.png)

The best algorithm as 1 shows is **Alg3** because its AUC is larger than AUC of other algorithms, in addition to Jaccard and Dice similarity, and the Hausdorff Distance is smaller than other algorithms.

The best algorithm as 2 shows is **Alg2** because its AUC is larger than the AUC of other algorithms.

![2D Evaluation for Image 3](./Docs/src/rdb025ll%20table.png)

The best algorithm as 3 shows is **Alg5** because its AUC is larger than the AUC of other algorithms, in addition to its Jaccard and Dice distances is a 2nd smaller distance.

The best algorithm as 4 shows is **Alg5** because its AUC is larger than the AUC of other algorithms, in addition to its Jaccard and Dice distances is a 2nd smaller distance.

## The Best Evaluation Measure

It depends on the input Data-set, There is no evaluation measure that is best for all cases, but each measure has some advantages and some disadvantages, and in general, the engineer must make a trade-off according to the application that he is about to evaluate.

## The Troubles I Have Encountered

- Dealing With Notebook in Matlab, the performance is prolonged.

- Canâ€™t use built-in trapezoid function in Matlab.

- Calculating Confusion Matrix parameters for 3D evaluation in one line.
